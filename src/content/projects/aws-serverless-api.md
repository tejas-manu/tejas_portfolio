# AWS Serverless API Platform

A highly scalable and cost-effective serverless API platform leveraging AWS services and modern DevOps practices.

## Project Overview

This serverless API platform demonstrates the implementation of microservices architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, with automated deployment and comprehensive monitoring.

## Architecture

### Core Services
- AWS Lambda for compute
- API Gateway for REST endpoints
- DynamoDB for data storage
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- S3 for file storage

### Key Features
- Serverless architecture
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated deployments

## Infrastructure as Code

The entire infrastructure is defined using AWS CDK:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';

export class ServerlessApiStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Lambda Function
    const handler = new lambda.Function(this, 'Handler', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
      handler: 'index.handler',
    });

    // API Gateway
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'Api', {
      restApiName: 'Serverless API',
    });

    api.root.addMethod('GET', new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(handler));
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Automated deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          npm run deploy
```

## Security Implementation

- API Key authentication
- IAM roles and policies
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- WAF integration

## Monitoring & Logging

### CloudWatch Integration
- Custom metrics
- Log aggregation

- Cold start optimization
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies
- Response compression

## Cost Management

- Pay-per-use model
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Resource optimization
- Cost allocation tags
- Budget alerts

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for Lambda functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing with Artillery
- Security testing
- Chaos engineering

## Documentation

- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Deployment procedures
