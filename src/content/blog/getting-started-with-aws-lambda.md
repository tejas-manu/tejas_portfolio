# Getting Started with AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. In this guide, we'll walk through creating and deploying your first Lambda function.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically runs your code and scales with your application's usage.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js
- AWS CLI installed and configured

## Creating Your First Lambda Function

1. Navigate to the AWS Lambda Console
2. Click "Create function"
3. Choose "Author from scratch"
4. Enter function name and runtime
5. Click "Create function"

## Writing the Function Code

Here's a simple example of a Lambda function:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
    return response;
};
```

## Testing the Function

1. Click "Test" in the Lambda console
2. Create a new test event
3. Run the test and verify the output

## Best Practices

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor function performance
- Set appropriate timeout values

## Deployment Strategies

- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Version your functions
- Use staging environments

## Monitoring and Logging

- Use CloudWatch Logs
- Set up alarms
- Monitor execution time
- Track error rates

## Security Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use IAM roles effectively
- Encrypt environment variables
- Regular security audits

## Cost Optimization

- Optimize memory allocation
- Monitor execution time
- Use provisioned concurrency when needed
- Implement proper timeout values

## Conclusion

AWS Lambda provides a powerful way to run code without managing servers. By following these best practices and guidelines, you can build efficient and scalable serverless applications.
